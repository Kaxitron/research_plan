> **Why this lesson exists:** Groups capture symmetry with one operation. Rings and fields add a second operation — and suddenly you can talk about polynomials, ideals, and the algebraic structures that underpin both modern algebra and algebraic geometry. You need rings to understand polynomial rings (the "coordinate ring" of a variety), ideals (which define subvarieties), and local rings (which describe what happens near a singularity). These are the building blocks of the algebraic geometry that SLT uses to analyze neural network loss landscapes.

## 🎯 Core Concepts

### Rings — Two Operations

- **A ring (R, +, ×)** has addition (forming an abelian group) and multiplication (associative, with identity, distributing over addition). Multiplication need not be commutative, and elements need not have multiplicative inverses.
- **Key examples:** ℤ (integers), ℤ_n (integers mod n), ℝ[x] (polynomials with real coefficients), M_n(ℝ) (n×n matrices).
- **Polynomial rings ℝ[x₁,...,xₙ]** are crucial: a polynomial like w₁² + w₂² - 1 is an element of ℝ[w₁, w₂]. The set of solutions {(w₁,w₂) : w₁² + w₂² = 1} is a circle — a **variety** defined by this polynomial. The loss function of a neural network is a polynomial (or analytic function) in the weights, and its critical points form a variety.

### Fields — Everything Divides

- **A field** is a commutative ring where every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse. You can divide by anything except zero.
- **Examples:** ℚ (rationals), ℝ (reals), ℂ (complex numbers), ℤ_p for prime p (finite fields).
- **Why ℂ matters:** algebraic geometry over ℂ is "nicer" than over ℝ — the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra guarantees every polynomial factors completely. SLT often works over ℂ for technical convenience, then translates back to ℝ.

### Ideals and Quotient Rings

- **An ideal I ⊂ R** is a subset closed under addition and under multiplication by ANY ring element. Ideals in rings play the role that normal subgroups play in groups.
- **The ideal generated by polynomials:** I = (f₁,...,fₖ) is the set of all combinations a₁f₁ + ... + aₖfₖ. The variety V(I) = {x : f₁(x) = ... = fₖ(x) = 0} is the set of common zeros.
- **Quotient ring R/I:** "set every element of I to zero." ℝ[x]/(x² + 1) is the complex numbers — you've added a new element (√-1) by declaring x² + 1 = 0.
- **For SLT:** the local ring at a singularity captures the algebraic structure "near" that point. The dimension and type of the singularity — which determine the RLCT — are read off from this local ring.

### Modules and Vector Spaces

- **A vector space** is a module over a field. You already know these from Phase 1.
- **A module** over a ring generalizes: scalar multiplication is by ring elements instead of field elements. Modules over ℤ are just abelian groups. Modules over ℝ[x] are vector spaces with a distinguished linear operator.
- **For ML context:** thinking of weight space as a module over the polynomial ring ℝ[w₁,...,wₙ] brings algebraic geometry tools to bear on the loss landscape.

### Noetherian Rings and the Hilbert Basis Theorem

- **A Noetherian ring** satisfies the ascending chain condition: every increasing chain of ideals eventually stabilizes. This means every ideal is finitely generated.
- **Hilbert's Basis Theorem:** ℝ[x₁,...,xₙ] is Noetherian. Any set of polynomial equations can be replaced by a finite set with the same solutions. This is why algebraic geometry works — varieties can always be described by finitely many equations.
- **For SLT:** the Noetherian property guarantees that the singularity structure of the loss landscape is "finite" in a precise sense — there are only finitely many types of singularities to classify.

## 🔨 Do

- Verify that ℤ₆ is a ring but not a field (find a nonzero element without an inverse: 2 × 3 = 0 mod 6 — zero divisors!).
- Construct ℂ as ℝ[x]/(x²+1). Show that (a + bx)(c + dx) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)x in this quotient ring — this IS complex multiplication.
- For the polynomial f(w₁,w₂) = w₁w₂ in ℝ[w₁,w₂], describe the variety V(f) = {(w₁,w₂) : w₁w₂ = 0}. What does this variety look like? (It's the union of the two coordinate axes — a singularity at the origin.)
- Compute the ideal (x², xy) in ℝ[x,y]. What variety does it define? What's the quotient ring ℝ[x,y]/(x², xy)?
