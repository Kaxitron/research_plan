> **Why this lesson exists:** Gödel's incompleteness theorems are the most profound results in mathematical logic — they show that any sufficiently powerful formal system contains true statements it cannot prove, and cannot prove its own consistency. For alignment, these results are directly relevant: an AI system reasoning about its own properties faces the same self-referential limitations. Löb's theorem — "if a system can prove 'if I can prove P then P,' then the system can prove P" — has been called "the most important theorem for AI alignment that nobody knows about." It constrains what AI systems can trust about their own reasoning.

## 🎯 Core Concepts

### Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem

- **The setup:** any consistent formal system F that is powerful enough to express basic arithmetic (Peano Arithmetic or stronger) and whose axioms are computably enumerable.
- **The result:** there exists a sentence G (the Gödel sentence) that is true but not provable in F. Moreover, G says "I am not provable in F" — it's self-referentially true.
- **The proof idea:** Gödel showed how to encode logical formulas as numbers (Gödel numbering). This lets the formal system "talk about" its own proofs. The Gödel sentence G is constructed using a diagonal argument (the same technique as the halting problem and Cantor's theorem).
- **The consequence:** mathematical truth outruns provability. No single formal system can capture all mathematical truths. You always need to "step outside" the system to see truths it can't prove.

### Gödel's Second Incompleteness Theorem

- **The result:** a consistent system F cannot prove its own consistency: F ⊬ Con(F), where Con(F) = ¬Prov(⊥) = "F does not prove a contradiction."
- **The consequence:** if you want to know that your formal system is consistent (doesn't prove both P and ¬P), you can't verify this from within the system. You need a stronger system — but then THAT system can't prove ITS own consistency.
- **For AI:** an AI system reasoning in a formal system cannot prove that its own reasoning is consistent. If an AI system claims "I will never output a contradiction," it either (1) is wrong, (2) is reasoning in a system where the claim can't even be formalized, or (3) is reasoning in a system that doesn't include basic arithmetic (too weak to be useful).

### Löb's Theorem — Self-Trust Under Suspicion

- **Statement:** in any system F containing Peano Arithmetic, if F ⊢ (Prov_F(P) → P), then F ⊢ P. In English: "if the system can prove 'if I can prove P, then P is true,' then the system can already prove P."
- **The contrapositive:** if F ⊬ P (the system can't prove P), then F ⊬ (Prov_F(P) → P) (the system can't prove that its own provability of P implies P's truth). In English: the system can't prove that its proofs are reliable for any specific unprovable statement.
- **Why this is shocking:** you might think "of course, if I can prove something, it's true" is obviously true. But Löb's theorem says the system can't prove this obvious fact about itself (for statements it can't independently prove).
- **For alignment:** an AI system cannot fully trust its own reasoning. If an agent has the policy "I'll do P if I can prove P is safe," Löb's theorem constrains what "safe" properties the agent can verify about its own actions. This is the formal foundation of the "reflective stability" problem in AI alignment.

### The Diagonal Lemma and Self-Reference

- **The Diagonal Lemma:** for any formula φ(x), there exists a sentence G such that F ⊢ G ↔ φ(⌜G⌝). In English: for any property, there's a sentence that says "I have this property." Self-reference is unavoidable in sufficiently powerful formal systems.
- **Applications:**
  - Gödel sentence: G says "I am not provable" (φ(x) = ¬Prov(x))
  - Liar paradox: L says "I am not true" (φ(x) = ¬True(x)) — this is why formal systems can't define their own truth predicate (Tarski's theorem)
  - Löb sentence: H says "if I am provable, then P" (φ(x) = Prov(x) → P)
- **For AI:** neural networks that reason about themselves (meta-learning, recursive self-improvement) face these self-referential constraints. The diagonal lemma guarantees that self-referential constructions exist — they can't be avoided by clever architecture design.

### Modal Logic and Provability Logic

- **Modal logic** adds operators: □P means "P is necessary" (or "P is provable"), ◇P means "P is possible" (or "P is consistent with the system").
- **GL (Gödel-Löb logic)** is the provability logic: it axiomatizes what a formal system can prove about its own provability. The key axiom is Löb's axiom: □(□P → P) → □P.
- **Fixed-point theorems in GL** tell you exactly which self-referential sentences a system can and cannot prove. These are the technical tools for analyzing reflectively stable AI agents.

### Implications for Alignment

- **The corrigibility problem:** a corrigible AI should accept being corrected. But if the AI reasons about whether it should accept correction, Löb-type constraints limit what it can prove about the correctness of its own shutdown behavior. The AI can't fully trust its proof that shutdown is good.
- **Vingean reflection:** an AI designing a successor can't prove the successor is aligned (by Gödel's second theorem — it can't prove the successor's consistency, which is weaker than alignment). This constrains recursive self-improvement.
- **Logical uncertainty:** because of incompleteness, an AI system will always face logical uncertainty — statements it can't determine the truth of. How should it handle these? This is an active area of alignment research (Garrabrant induction, logical counterfactuals).
- **MIRI's research program** (the Machine Intelligence Research Institute) is heavily based on these ideas. Understanding Gödel and Löb is prerequisite for engaging with their technical agenda.

## 🔨 Do

- Walk through Gödel's proof for a specific system: construct the Gödel sentence for a toy proof system. Verify it's true but unprovable.
- Prove Löb's theorem from the Hilbert-Bernays derivability conditions. (This is a hard exercise — attempt it, use references as needed.)
- Formalize the "shutdown problem": an agent A reasons about whether it should allow shutdown. Using provability logic, show that A cannot prove "if I prove shutdown is good, then shutdown is good" (by Löb, this would require A to prove shutdown is good, which requires verification it can't complete).
- Read the Yudkowsky & Herreshoff "Tiling Agents" paper. Write a one-page summary of the main impossibility result and its implications for recursive self-improvement.
- Essay: Compare the halting problem (Lesson 51), Rice's theorem, Gödel's incompleteness, and Löb's theorem. What's the common thread? How do these four impossibility results collectively constrain the alignment research program?

## 🧠 Alignment Connection

Löb's theorem has direct, devastating implications for self-improving AI. An agent that can modify its own code cannot, in general, prove that its successor will maintain alignment — because Löb's theorem says "if I can prove my successor is aligned, then I am aligned" requires *already being aligned* to conclude. This creates a fundamental barrier to verified recursive self-improvement. The Yudkowsky & Herreshoff "Tiling Agents" paper formalizes this: provably aligned AI that improves itself may be impossible using standard proof-theoretic methods. This is one of the deepest known impossibility results in alignment theory.
