> **Why this lesson exists:** Taylor expansions are the single most used tool in theoretical ML. When a paper says "to second order," "locally quadratic," or "the Hessian approximation," they're using Taylor's theorem. The loss landscape near any critical point IS its Taylor expansion. The implicit function theorem tells you when you can "solve" one variable in terms of others locally — it's the rigorous foundation for bifurcation theory, sensitivity analysis, and understanding how model behavior changes with hyperparameters.

## 🎯 Core Concepts

### Taylor Expansion in 1D — The Idea

- **Core insight:** any smooth function can be approximated near a point a by a polynomial: f(x) ≈ f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + ½f''(a)(x-a)² + ⅙f'''(a)(x-a)³ + ...
- **Zeroth order:** constant approximation f(x) ≈ f(a). "The function is approximately its value."
- **First order:** linear approximation f(x) ≈ f(a) + f'(a)(x-a). "The function is approximately its tangent line." This is what gradient descent uses — it follows the linear approximation of the loss.
- **Second order:** quadratic approximation f(x) ≈ f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + ½f''(a)(x-a)². "The function is approximately a parabola." Newton's method uses this — it finds the minimum of the quadratic approximation.

### Multivariate Taylor Expansion — The Hessian IS Second-Order

- **For f: ℝⁿ → ℝ near a point w₀:** f(w) ≈ f(w₀) + ∇f(w₀)ᵀ(w-w₀) + ½(w-w₀)ᵀH(w₀)(w-w₀) where H is the Hessian matrix of second partial derivatives.
- **At a critical point (∇f = 0):** f(w) ≈ f(w₀) + ½(w-w₀)ᵀH(w-w₀). The loss landscape near a critical point IS a quadratic form determined by the Hessian. Everything you learned about quadratic forms, eigenvalues, and condition numbers in Phase 1 directly describes the local loss landscape.
- **The Hessian eigenvectors** are the principal directions of curvature. The eigenvalues are the curvatures along those directions. This is why eigenvalue analysis of the Hessian tells you everything about local training dynamics (as you'll see in the ODE lessons).

### The Implicit Function Theorem

- **The setup:** given F(x,y) = 0, when can you solve for y as a function of x? Geometrically: when is the level set F = 0 a graph near a point?
- **The answer:** if ∂F/∂y ≠ 0 at the point, then locally y = g(x) exists and g'(x) = -(∂F/∂x)/(∂F/∂y). The theorem tells you WHEN implicit solutions exist and HOW they depend on parameters.
- **For ML/alignment:** if F(θ, λ) = 0 defines the critical points of a loss as a function of hyperparameter λ, the implicit function theorem tells you how critical points move as λ changes — sensitivity analysis. When ∂F/∂θ becomes singular (zero), the implicit function theorem fails: this is exactly a bifurcation point where critical points appear, disappear, or change character.
- **For SLT:** singularities in the loss landscape occur precisely where the implicit function theorem fails — where the Jacobian of the gradient becomes degenerate. These singularities are the central objects of study in Singular Learning Theory.

### Big-O Notation and Asymptotic Analysis

- **f(x) = O(g(x))** means f grows no faster than g. Formally: |f(x)| ≤ C|g(x)| for large enough x (or near a point).
- **In Taylor expansions:** f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + O((x-a)²) means the error is at most quadratic. This is how papers compress "we dropped all higher-order terms."
- **For ML theory:** scaling laws, generalization bounds, and approximation rates are all stated in Big-O notation. Fluency with asymptotic notation is essential for reading theory papers.

## 🔨 Do

- Taylor-expand sin(x) to 1st, 3rd, 5th order around x=0. Plot each approximation against the true function. See convergence.
- For L(w₁,w₂) = (w₁²-1)² + w₂², compute the Hessian at each critical point. Write the second-order Taylor expansion. Verify that the Hessian eigenvalues predict the curvature you see in contour plots.
- Apply the implicit function theorem: for F(x,λ) = x³ - λx = 0, find the critical points as functions of λ. Identify where the IFT fails (bifurcation points).
- Newton's method implementation: minimize f(x) = x⁴ - 3x² + x using (a) gradient descent and (b) Newton's method (using the second-order Taylor approximation). Compare convergence speed.

## 🔗 ML & Alignment Connection

- **Second-order optimizers** (Newton, natural gradient, K-FAC) use the Hessian or its approximation to take smarter steps — they're minimizing the second-order Taylor expansion rather than following the linear approximation.
- **Learning rate and curvature:** the optimal learning rate for a quadratic loss is 1/λ_max (inverse of largest Hessian eigenvalue). This comes directly from the Taylor expansion.
- **Scaling laws** — the empirical finding that loss scales as L(N) ~ N^{-α} — are asymptotic statements that Taylor/power-series analysis helps interpret rigorously. Understanding when these power laws break down (phase transitions, emergent capabilities) is critical for predicting when models might suddenly become dangerous.
