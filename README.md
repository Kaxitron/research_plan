# The Path to AI Alignment

## A Complete Self-Study Curriculum: Mathematics → Neural Networks → Alignment

---

**Goal:** Develop deep intuitive understanding of the mathematics underlying neural networks, the architecture and philosophy of modern AI systems, and the tools of mechanistic interpretability — all in service of solving AI alignment.

**Your profile:** Good mathematical intuition, intermediate C++/Python, refreshing math after a 6-year gap. You learn best through geometric intuition first, then mechanics. Pace: ~33% slower than typical technical presentation.

**Estimated total time:** 6–8 months at a steady pace.

## How to Use This Plan

Each lesson block contains:

- **🎯 Core learning** — what we'll work through together in our sessions
- **📺 Watch** — videos organized as Primary → Secondary → Tertiary
- **📖 Read** — supplementary reading, similarly layered
- **🔨 Do** — hands-on exercises and coding projects
- **🔗 ML Connection** — why this matters for alignment work
- **🧠 Alignment Connection** — direct ties to alignment research

### Recommended Learning Stack Per Concept

```
3Blue1Brown video (geometric intuition)
    ↓
MIT OCW / Strang lecture (deeper understanding, formal framework)
    ↓
MML Book chapter (ML-focused notation)
    ↓
Interactive Linear Algebra / Immersive Math (play with it)
    ↓
Exercises & Python code (make it stick)
    ↓
ML connection discussion (why it matters)
```

You don't need ALL resources for every concept. Use 3B1B as your primary and add others where you want more depth.

*This plan is a living document. As you progress, we'll adjust pacing, add resources, and dive deeper into areas that resonate. The goal isn't to memorize procedures — it's to build the geometric intuition that lets you "see" what a matrix does the way you "see" what addition does.*
