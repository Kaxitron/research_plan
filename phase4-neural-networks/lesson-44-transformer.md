# Lesson 44: Building a Transformer from Scratch

## 🎯 Core Learning

- Token embeddings: words → vectors (a learned lookup table)
- Positional encodings: giving the model a sense of order
- The full transformer block: attention → add & norm → MLP → add & norm
- Stacking blocks: depth = abstraction
- MLP layers: what they do between attention (possibly store facts)
- Causal masking: preventing the model from "seeing the future"
- The complete GPT architecture from input to next-token prediction
- **Modern variants:** Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) as used in DeepSeek

## 📺 Watch — Primary

1. **Karpathy — "Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out" (Lecture 7)**
   - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY
   - *~2 hours. You build a working GPT from scratch. Transformative.*

2. **3Blue1Brown — "How might LLMs store facts" | Deep Learning Ch. 7**

## 📺 Watch — Secondary

3. **Welch Labs — "How DeepSeek Rewrote the Transformer [MLA]"**
   - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAxYGT4VtBo
   - *📖 Book: Welch Labs, "The Illustrated Guide to AI," Ch. 8: Attention*
   - *18 minutes. After building a standard GPT, this shows you a real frontier modification: Multi-head Latent Attention, the architectural innovation that made DeepSeek 57× more efficient. Watch AFTER Karpathy to appreciate what's being changed and why.*

## 📖 Read

- **"A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits" (Elhage, Nanda, et al.)**
  - https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html
  - *The foundational paper of mechanistic interpretability. Uses ALL the linear algebra you learned.*
- **Neel Nanda's walkthrough of the above**

## 🔨 Do

- Complete Karpathy's GPT build — type every line, run it, generate text
- Optionally: ARENA Chapter 1 exercises (building GPT-3 from scratch)

## 🔗 ML & Alignment Connection

You now understand the complete architecture of every frontier AI system, including Claude. Every interpretability technique — activation patching, logit attribution, circuit analysis — operates on this architecture. Every alignment training method — RLHF, constitutional AI, DPO — modifies these weights through backpropagation. Understanding the transformer end-to-end means you can now engage with the central question: *how do we ensure systems built on this architecture behave in accordance with human values?*
